# mjbots pi3 hat #

This is the reference documentation for the mjbots pi3hat r4.5.
What is it?

The mjbots pi3hat is a daughterboard for a Raspberry Pi (tm) 3 or
Raspberry Pi 4 [1], which provides the following:

 * Power input from 8-54V [2], provides 5V for Raspberry Pi
 * 5x independent 5Mbps CAN-FD buses
 * A 1kHz IMU and attitude reference system
 * A spread spectrum nrf24l01 interface

1. The pi3hat is not compatible with the Raspberry Pi 1, 2, or 5.
2. The pi3hat r4.4 and earlier support 8-44V DC input.

# Pinouts #

## J1/J2 ##

XT30-M power input/output.  The chamfered side of the connector is
negative.

## JC1/JC2/JC3/JC4/JC5 ##

These are JST PH-3, 5Mbps CAN-FD connectors.  Each has a physical
termination resistor permanently installed.

* Pin 1: CANH
* Pin 2: CANL
* Pin 3: Ground

# Orientation #

The pi3hat uses a right handed coordinate system.  The raw IMU
accelerations and rotations are measured about the following axes:

* +x - towards the CAN connectors or HDMI connectors on the RPI
* +y - towards the USB ports on the rpi
* +z - up from the rpi towards the pi3hat

Attitude is measured with respect to a coordinate system of:
* +x forward
* +y right
* +z down

That means, in the absence of any configured mounting angle, the
raspberry pi must be inverted to achieve a pitch and roll of 0.

Finally, note that pi3hat is only an "attitude reference system", and
contains no sensors for measuring heading.  Thus the yaw or heading
value will drift over time and the yaw rate will have a non-zero bias
offset.

# Usage with client-side tools #

## tview / moteus_tool ##

First, install the python library:

```
python -m venv --system-site-packages moteus-venv
source moteus-venv/bin/activate

pip3 install moteus moteus-pi3hat
```

Then both `moteus_tool` and `tview` will be aware of the pi3hat, and
will use its port JC1 by default if no fdcanusb is present.

To use other ports, you need to tell the tool which IDs are present on
which port using the `--pi3hat-cfg` command line option.  It has the
following syntax:

```
--pi3hat-cfg 'BUS1=ID1,ID2,ID3;BUS2=ID4,ID5,ID6
```

So, an example where servo ID 1 and 6 are present on port JC1 (bus 1),
and 3 and 7 are present on port JC2 (bus 2), would look like:

```
sudo bash
source moteus-venv/bin/activate

tview --pi3hat-cfg '1=1,6;2=3,7' -t 1,3,6,7
```

The same `--pi3hat-cfg` works for `moteus_tool` as for `tview`.

## Python ##

Simply perform:

```
sudo apt install libraspberrypi-dev

# If not already created
# python -m venv --system-site-packages moteus-venv

source moteus-venv/bin/activate
pip3 install moteus-pi3hat
```

Then use the same API documented at:
https://github.com/mjbots/moteus/tree/main/lib/python with the caveat that all scripts must be executed as root.

Alternately, the pi3hat transport can be constructed directly using:

```
import moteus
import moteus_pi3hat

transport = moteus_pi3hat.Pi3HatRouter(
    servo_bus_map={...},
)
controller = moteus.Controller(id=1, transport=transport)
```


## C++ ##

To use the pi3hat with C++, a library is provided at:
 https://github.com/mjbots/pi3hat/blob/master/lib/cpp/mjbots/pi3hat/pi3hat.h

It consists of a single standalone C++11 header and source file, which
depends upon nothing but the standard library.  The library provides a
blocking interface that allows all the ports and features to be used
in an efficient manner.  Internally, it bypasses the linux kernel
drivers (which requires it to be run as root), and sometimes
busy-waits the CPU, in order to achieve tight timing performance.

There is a sample user of this library, `pi3hat_tool` in the same
directory which provides a simple command line program that exercises
all of its functionality.

## Board level documentation ##

If you wish to use the existing linux kernel SPI drivers, or write a
custom driver, the board theory of operation and SPI register mappings
are described here.

Internally, the board has 3 separate STM32 processors, each attached
to a SPI bus on the Raspberry Pi:

* *Processor 1* The first processor provides the high speed CAN-FD
  interfaces for CAN connectors JC1 and JC2.  It is connected to the
  Raspberry Pi SPI1 bus, CS0.  Those are the following pins on the 40
  pin GPIO header:

  * Pin 35: CIPO (BCM 19)
  * Pin 38: COPI (BCM 20)
  * Pin 40: SCLK (BCM 21)
  * Pin 12: CS   (BCM 18)
  * Pin 37: IRQ  (BCM 26)

* *Processor 2*: This processor provides the CAN-FD interfaces for JC3
  and JC4.  It is connected to the Raspberry Pi SPI1 bus, CS1.  Pins:

  * Pin 35: CIPO (BCM 19)
  * Pin 38: COPI (BCM 20)
  * Pin 40: SCLK (BCM 21)
  * Pin 11: CS   (BCM 17)
  * Pin 29: IRQ  (BCM 5)

* *Processor 3*: This processor provides the low-speed CAN interface,
  the IMU, and the nrf24l01 logic.  It is connected to the Raspberry
  Pi SPI0 bus, CS0.

  * Pin 21: CIPO (BCM 9)
  * Pin 19: COPI (BCM 10)
  * Pin 23: SCLK (BCM 11)
  * Pin 24: CS   (BCM 8)
  * Pin 15: IRQ  (BCM 22)
  * Pin 16: IRQ  (BCM 23)
  * Pin 18: IRQ  (BCM 24)

# Debugging connectors #

## JP6 ##

 * 1: 5V
 * 2: 3.3V
 * 3: Ground

## I2C ##

This connector directly breaks out I2C pins from the Raspberry Pi:

 * 1: 3.3V
 * 2: SDA / RPI Pin 3
 * 3: SCL / RPI Pin 5
 * 4: Ground

## UT ##

This connector directly breaks out UART pins from the Raspberry Pi:

 * 1: TX / RPI 32
 * 2: RX / RPI 33
 * 3: Ground

## JP4 ##

Reserved debugging connector for processor 1.

## JP3 ##

Reserved debugging connector for processor 2

## JP2 ##

Reserved debugging connector for processor 3

# SPI Protocol #

All of the processors use the same basic SPI protocol, with unique
registers for each of the various functions.

Maximum frequency: 10MHz

The following sequence is used for all SPI transactions (write or
read).

1. CS is pulled low
2. A >= 3 us hold time
3. An 8 byte address is written MSB first
4. A >= 3 us hold time
5. One or more bytes can now be read or written.  When reading, 0's
   should be clocked out.  When writing, the return value can be
   ignored.  Each "address" logically consists of sequence of bytes.
6. A >= 3 us hold time
7. CS is pulled high
8. A minimum 3us turnaround time is required before CS can be pulled
   low again.

## RF Register Mapping ##

If a nrf24l01 module is attached, the pi3hat implements a spread
spectrum receiver.  This receiver must be configured with the same ID
as the transmitter for communication to take place.

Each "slot" is transmitted independently and repeatedly according to
the given bitmask schedule.  The individual RF frames occur at 50Hz,
and each bit in the bitmask controls whether the data should be sent
in that particular frame.  So 0xaaaaaaaa would result in the data
being sent every other frame.

* *48* Protocol version: A constant byte 0x11
* *49* Read ID
  * byte 0-3: Common RF ID
* *50* Write ID
* *51* Set data for transmission
  * byte 0: Slot number (0-15)
  * byte 1-4: Transmission schedule (little endian)
  * byte 5+: Data
* *52* Read status
  * byte 0-3: uint32 rx slot counter, 2 bits per slot (little endian)
    * each time new data is received from the transmitter, the 2 bit
      counter for that slot is incremented
  * byte 4-7: uint32 age since last lock from tx (little endian)
* *64-79* Read data from remote transmitter
  * byte 0-3: uint32 age in ms (little endian)
  * byte 4: size (0-16)
  * byte 5-20: data


# Flashing new firmware #

To flash new firmware, openocd 0.11.0 or newer is required.  You can find binaries for many platforms at: https://xpack.github.io/openocd/releases/

Flashing can be performed using the `flash.py` script, for instance to flash a newly compiled image:

```
./flash.py
```

Or to flash a specific .elf file

```
./flash.py 20211129-pi3hat-71c002e71ce804959e681dc7043f6fb5d8147cac.elf
```

Each of the three processors needs to be flashed with the same image.

# pi3hat_tool #

Compiled versions of pi3hat_tool can be found in each github release: https://github.com/mjbots/pi3hat/releases

You want the YYYYMMDD-pi3hat_tools-*.bz2, selecting the appropriate
file for your architecture.

pi3hat_tool can be used perform various diagnostic functions,
including reading attitude:

```
pi@realtimepi:~ $  sudo bash

root@raspberrypi:/home/pi# ./pi3hat_tools/pi3hat_tool --read-att
```

Which will then display the current attitude information.
